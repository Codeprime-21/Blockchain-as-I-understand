# Blockchain-as-I-understand
Hey peeps! welcome to my repository!
I was really curious to learn blockchain technology. I thought I wouldn't get many resources because the topic is "relatively" new. Instead, I got many!😂
None of them were beginner friendly. I mean one can understand what a particular article is talking about...but the terms were so technical that I had to google every singl word seperately for it to make some sense for me!
I thought why shouldn't one understand something in "human language" and most easiest way possible.
The result is this repository.
I don't know how many repos are out there explaining more clearly.But, this serves as my notes as well and it also helps me through people like you who are kind enough to suggest and make changes to my repo.
Until now, I have all my project related and other theory notes in my physical notebook. In the coming days,I'll try to add them all here to help all of you people like me and in return helping myself!
cheers!✌🏻😎
